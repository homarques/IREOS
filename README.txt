Included in this distribution is an example data set (WBC_withoutdupl_norm) which consists of 223 objects, each with 9 attributes, this data set is a publicly available real world datasets from the UCI repository modified following the procedure described in the paper.
Also included are 11 outlier solutions of the data set (folder solutions) which the name of the file is the number of outliers correctly labeled according to the ground truth.
